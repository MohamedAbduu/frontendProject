#MY PAGES

**Home** The home page should be designed to provide users with a clear understanding of the app's purpose and how it can help them. It should have an inviting design that entices users to explore the app further. This page should also include a prominent call-to-action button that encourages users to sign up or log in to their account.



**Signup/Login:** The sign-up and login pages should be simple and easy to use. Users should be able to create a new account or log in to an existing account with minimal effort. It can offer several options for users to sign up, such as using their email address, social media account, or mobile number.



**Dashboard:** The dashboard is the main page that users will see when they log in to the app. It should provide an overview of the user's goals, progress, and achievements. The dashboard can include features like a progress bar, graphs, and charts to display data in an easy-to-understand format.



**Tracking:** This page is where users will spend most of their time on the app. It should be designed to make it easy for users to log their meals, snacks, and drinks. It can include features like a barcode scanner, a searchable database of foods, and the ability to create custom meals. Users should also be able to track other metrics like exercise and water intake.



**Nutrition education:** This page is where I can provide users with educational resources on nutrition and healthy eating. It can include articles, videos, infographics, and recipes to help users make healthier choices. It can also create a library of meal plans and grocery lists to help users plan their meals and snacks.








**THIS IS TO BE COMPLETED LATER**

**Community:** The community page is where users can connect with each other for support and motivation. I can create a forum where users can ask questions, share tips, and interact with other users. I can also include features like messaging, commenting, and liking to make it easy for users to engage with each other.



**Settings:** The settings page is where users can customize their experience on the app. I can include features like notifications, reminders, and personal information. Users should be able to update their goals, preferences, and account information from this page.



**Support:** The support page is where users can get help if they have any issues with the app. You can provide contact information for customer support, frequently asked questions, and other resources to help users get the most out of the app.



By designing an app that is easy to use and provides users with valuable resources, it can help them make healthier choices and achieve their health goals.
