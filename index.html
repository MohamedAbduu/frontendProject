    <h3>Nutrition facts</h3>
    <p >
      nutrition is essential for maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle. 
      It provides us with the necessary nutrients, vitamins, and minerals that our body requires to function properly. 
      The food we eat plays a significant role in determining our overall health,
      and hence it is essential to maintain a healthy and balanced diet.<br>

      <br> A healthy diet helps us maintain a healthy weight, reduces the risk of chronic diseases, 
      and enhances our energy levels. It provides us with the necessary nutrients and energy to carry out our daily activities and improves our immune system,
      which helps us fight off diseases and infections. 
      In contrast, an unhealthy diet can lead to obesity, heart diseases, diabetes, and other chronic diseases.<br>
      
      <br> Eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, 
      and healthy fats is the key to a healthy and balanced diet. 
      Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, 
      which help in maintaining a healthy digestive system and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. 
      Whole grains provide us with complex carbohydrates, 
      which release energy slowly and keep us full for a longer duration. 
      Lean proteins are essential for building and repairing muscles and tissues, 
      while healthy fats provide us with essential fatty acids that our body cannot produce.<br>
      
      <!-- <br> Another essential aspect of healthy nutrition is portion control. 
      Eating too much of anything can lead to weight gain and an increased risk of chronic diseases. 
      Hence, it is important to eat in moderation and be mindful of our portions. 
      It is also important to limit our intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and foods high in saturated and trans fats, 
      as they can lead to various health problems.<br>
      
      <br> Healthy nutrition not only benefits us physically but also mentally. 
      A balanced diet helps us maintain good mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. 
      Studies have shown that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants can improve brain function and reduce the risk of cognitive decline.<br>
      
      <br> In conclusion, healthy nutrition is crucial for maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle. 
      A balanced diet provides us with the necessary nutrients, vitamins, and minerals that our body requires to function properly. 
      It reduces the risk of chronic diseases, improves our energy levels, and enhances our immune system. Hence, 
      it is important to make healthy food choices and practice portion control to ensure that we maintain a healthy and balanced diet.
